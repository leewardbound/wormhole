Danit will introduce them to Nouns and tell them about the opportunity to build on top of the protocol.  \n\t* The collection's exhibition area is going to be a custom built interactive experience. It will include an AR installation and holograms representing the collection \u0026 Nouns.\n* **Showcase the collection in future events, museums, and galleries. Use this collection to introduce Nouns to new audiences.**\n\t* Danit will make the collection available to show in future events where Nouns have presence (like NFT NYC, NFT Aus, ETH Bogota/SF etc.)\n\t* Danit will (and has already started) introduce Nouns at her lectures in various events, e.g. at a recent workshop for executives at a very large luxury multinational corp.\n* **Who is Danit**?\n\t* Danit is one of the world's leading experts \u0026 innovators in 3D-printed clothes and textiles.\n\t* Her [TED talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/danit_peleg_forget_shopping_soon_you_ll_download_your_new_clothes) received more than 2M views. \n\t* Danit's past work has been in the [Opening Ceremony of the 2016 Rio Paralympics](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dFEBaJWzER8), Triannale di Milano, Maker Faire, The National Center for Craft \u0026 Design, The Franklin Institute, Landesmuseum Württemberg Stuttgart.. and many more\n*  **This prop is for the last milestones of the Nouns 3D-printed collection. Here are the two past proposals:**\n\t* [Prop 26](https://nouns.wtf/vote/26)\n\t* [Prop 41](https://nouns.wtf/vote/41)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n----\n![isthisgood.gif](https://media.tenor.com/oN01aqzvhFwAAAAC/nounish-nouns-dao.gif)\n### Why should Nouns fund a 3D-printed fashion collection?\n\n*  3D-printed fashion is nascent and experimental. Not unlike Nouns, it's at the intersection of art, culture \u0026 tech. \n*  The tech being so new, and the visuals so striking, 3D-printed clothes and textiles get a lot of attention. The collection is eye-catching and different. It can be used to attract attention at various events. \n*  Fashion executives, especially in the innovation departments of big brands, are always on the lookout for the next thing. Through this collection nouns will stand out and help future potential brands learn about the opportunity to build on this open-source brand!\n* It's also just very nounish: pushing the boundaries of fashion in an authentic way.\n---\n\n### What does this proposal include?\n\n* Finish modeling and printing 5 looks.\n* Attending NFT Paris with a custom-built exhibition space, in a magnificent historic location, the Grand Palais.\n\n### Why combine finalizing the collection with the NFT Paris event? \n* Since it's physical, I want the collection to get exposure and eyeballs IRL. This event has the perfect audience and location. It is very fashion-oriented and is an NFT event.  \n\n\n### Progress since my last proposal:\n\n* Participated in the first [metaverse fashion week](https://twitter.com/danitpeleg3d/status/1508118881570897927) with the Nouns collection\n* 90% finished Patternmaking, Modeling, and Rendering all the looks.\n* Printed the first garment in Polyjet: the “king” dress and assembled it.\n* Started making a special Nouns filament for printing with FDM tech.\n\n\n### Progress on Roadmap:\n\n1. ☑ **Research** - Inspiration board, material research, printing samples\n2. ☑ **Design** - sketches\n3. ☑ **Patternmaking/Rendering/Modeling** - 3D modeling the sketches into 3D-printable files\n4. ☑ **Print Testing** - testing many different types of printers, configurations, materials etc\n5. ☑ **Participate in Metaverse Fashion Week (MVFW)**\n6. **STARTED: Printing finals** - printing the entire collection\n7. **STARTED: Assembling** - using different techniques (e.g. gluing, knotting, etc) to assemble the collection together\n8. **Photoshoot (with real-life models)** - for press materials, websites, AR filter etc\n9. **NEW: Showcase collection at NFT Paris** - Invited \u0026 will have a booth and interactive AR display\n10. **Marketing** - prepare press kit. The collection gets PR, is booked for events, and showcases galleries \u0026 museums\n\n## Some images from my progress:\n\n### The collection's sketches\n[![image-1.png](https://i.postimg.cc/CKxgm5tJ/image-1.png)](https://postimg.cc/FY88KrhJ)\n\n### Washing the printed king dress\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-26-26.png](https://i.postimg.cc/hGYC7LSc/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-26-26.png)](https://postimg.cc/QBpg2W9y)\n\n[![image-2.png](https://i.postimg.cc/cCnpzndy/image-2.png)](https://postimg.cc/p5Pchy9q)\n\n### Assembling the top of this look\n\n[![image.png](https://i.postimg.cc/rsPcrkgg/image.png)](https://postimg.cc/p5z3w3wn)\n\n\n---\n\n## Showcasing at NFT Paris\n\n### The event\n\n\n* [NFT Paris](https://www.nftparis.xyz/) will take place on February 24-25, 2023. A day before the start of Paris Fashion Week.\n* The event is taking place at the \"[Grand Palais Éphémère](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Palais_%C3%89ph%C3%A9m%C3%A8re)\", one of the most iconic locations for fashion in France (home of the most creative and artistic events in Europe, such as Art Basel Paris and all of Chanel fashion shows).\n* More than 15,000 people are expected to attend the event.\n* The event will bring together the biggest names of the industry and top-executives from major brands (Prada, LVMH, Farfetch, Lacoste, The Fabricant to name a few)\n* A large array of Fashion media outlets will be present and we hope will cover my story (Vogue, Artnet, Coindesk, Forbes, Elle, Journal du Luxe, Business of Fashion, Grazia….).\n\n\n### The installation\n\n* Working with [Orbis](https://orbis-prod.fr/en/home-en/), a world-class creator of immersive and experiential spaces, we will showcase the 3d printed collection and the universe of Nouns.\n* The vision of this installation is to bring to life digital fashion pieces from the collection created by Danit Peleg, through different media: screens, AR, holograms, physical pieces. The installation will be segmented into different activations.\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-22-20.png](https://i.postimg.cc/4NRxnjtq/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-22-20.png)](https://postimg.cc/z3prctxF)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-25-11.png](https://i.postimg.cc/fTVfTtcB/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-11-25-11.png)](https://postimg.cc/nCtD3LwD)\n\n\n\n1. **AR experience mannequin:** this centred piece will be used as a support for attendees to enjoy digital fashion pieces with Augmented Reality\n\n[![Screen-Recording-2022-12-19-at-11-29-52.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/rpzkh27h/Screen-Recording-2022-12-19-at-11-29-52.gif)](https://postimg.cc/xkrhChfH)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-12-06.png](https://i.postimg.cc/LsxSd14P/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-12-06.png)](https://postimg.cc/zLH6K3gD)\n\n2. **LED 56cm fans:** these fans will create holographic fashion pieces from the collection\n\n\n[![fans.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/50QBc85K/fans.gif)](https://postimg.cc/LYRYLYbj)\n\n3. **POP3 holographic displays:** this digital display solution will recreate an entire digital fashion show by designing a digital catwalk on which both avatars and nouns will be brought to life\n\n[![pop3.gif](https://i.postimg.cc/jqN1PfVh/pop3.gif)](https://postimg.cc/PNXKkP5L)\n\n4. **Mannequin with physical fashion pieces:** this mannequin will be used as support to showcase printed pieces designed by Danit Peleg\n\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-10-07.png](https://i.postimg.cc/gJGxsRS6/Screen-Shot-2022-12-19-at-16-10-07.png)](https://postimg.cc/mc6Z2cGb)\n\n5. **Video projector:** the screen will display videos from nounish ⌐◨-◨  (and hopefully a specific video made about my project) to share Nouns stories further and show the different steps of creation/production of the collection. \n\n\n### Additional activations\n\n* 15-minute session to present the collaboration with Nouns\n* 30 tickets to NFT Paris for the community\n\n\n## Budget\n* Finalizing \u0026 printing all models and photoshoot: 67,153€\n* NFT Paris \u0026 Booth Installation: 50,700€\n* Total ask: 125,457 USDC (117,853€)\n\n## Budget Breakdown\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-15-31.png](https://i.postimg.cc/HLVtYQYC/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-15-31.png)](https://postimg.cc/McJBtffs)\n[![Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-16-51.png](https://i.postimg.cc/66mtTKfJ/Screen-Shot-2022-12-20-at-10-16-51.png)](https://postimg.cc/6TnD1DPY)\n\n\n\n### Timeline\n1. **End of December:** Launch of production.\n3. **Early January:** Construction and assembly of the booth.\n4. **Mid January:** Marketing by NFT Paris.\n5. **January - February:** Finalize collection and photoshoot.\n6. **February 24-25:** NFT Paris!!\n\n\nI can't wait to finish my super nounish collection \u0026 bring it to awesome stages around the world!\n THANK YOU for your time and support!!! \n\n[Danit ⌐◨-◨](https://www.instagram.com/danitpeleg3d/)\n\n\nTransactions:\n\n* **To Danit's wallet: 72,547 USDC (68,353 Euro)** to 0x81EB3Fd07d84bD3aa0F4Df1359D87820F4cCbEf9 \n* **To NFT Paris wallet: 52,699 USDC (49,500 Euro)** to 0x48EeB021f2C56d4f8d2A741D2582A679B4C2B87A ",

      "description": "# THE NOUNSVITATIONAL: Tier 1 Esports Event!\n\n*Nouns Esports is submitting this proposal on behalf of [Slacks](https://twitter.com/SirActionSlacks) \u0026 [Kyle](https://twitter.com/keepingitkyle) from WePlay Esports.* \n\n### Hello NounsDAO!\n\nWe are Weplay, a globally recognized Esports event company who specialize in creating groundbreaking productions in the world of gaming. From weekly shows with the NFL and top Twitch Streamers, to multi-million dollar Esports events such as the (Emmy Nominated) Dota 2  Animajor, we pride ourselves on making the most memorable and exciting events in Esports. \n\nNow, it's time for Nouns to have one of their very own: THE NOUNSVITATIONAL! \n\n## Please watch our short VIDEO PROPOSAL BELOW! \n\n\n\n[![https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2pet9rHvlNs](https://i.imgur.com/IQh4GII.png) ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6nhwg_nlX-w)\n\n---\n\n \n Short and sweet: we believe that an Esports event can take Nouns to new heights. We don't want to just show people some Noggles and call it a day - We want to enact a 3 step mass integration program designed around introducing (and integrating) the esports public at large into Web3, Nouns communities, and furthering the Nouns mission.  \n \n \n \n### Introduction \n \n We first learned about Nouns after your fantastic Dota 2 team entered the scene, and we got to know a few of the amazing folks over at the Nouns Esports crew. After doing our research on Nouns, we were impressed to find a group of people who were different from the normal Dota 2 Esports sponsors. In a scene plagued by Betting Companies, Scam Coins, and other nefarious evil-doers, it was refreshing to find a group of people using Crypto in a positive way; One that we would be proud to partner with to spread their message. Weplay prides itself on being the best in our industry and working with the best in their industry, and we believe that this project would be one of those partnerships. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/wb1Bub0.jpg)\n\n \n ### What we Offer\n \n What Nouns Proposals have been doing so far is great, but we believe we can do so much more for the growth of Nouns in the eyes of the general public. Many of your successfully executed Proposals in the past have focused on getting the brand of Nouns out there with general advertising methods of simply \"showing the brand\". What we offer is not only brand recognition, but brand integration, on a wide and universal scale. \n \nWe don't just want people to know what Noggles are. We want people to know about the Nouns mission, the point of a DAO, and to get people who have never heard of Crypto or NFT's (even people who actively dislike them) to see the Web3 world in a positive light by having them actively participate in a system designed around an event that we know they want to watch. \n \n![](https://i.imgur.com/Ay6mRjf.jpg)\n\n \n  ### The 3 Step Plan \n  \n  Our idea is simple: get viewers to come for the Dota, and stay for the Nouns.  ⌐◨-◨\n  \n1. ENTERTAIN\n\nCreating a custom, interesting Dota Tournament structure with a dual purpose of getting as many viewers as possible to watch due to its innovative nature, world class teams, and Dota's best Talent while also subtly introducing them to a DAO structure in a positive way.\n\n2. EDUCATE\n\nOnce they come for the world class Dota, educate them about Nouns with direct, custom created content which Nouns can use forever (Nouns explainers, DAO explainers, Web3 explainers, and even mini-docs about past successful proposals and interviews) which we will play in-between the games to show that Nouns are one of the good guys, and that this system is something they can be a part of\n\n3. INTEGRATE\n\nUsing a POAP system, and focusing on a \"Mini Dota DAO\" designed around people who have no idea what Web3 is or don't even have crypto wallets, we aim to make the \"scary world of crypto\" something that viewers actively participate in both rewarding and fun as they collect Dota 2 themed POAPs during the event. By utilizing in-game systems, viewers can even trade these POAPs for digital cosmetics in Dota 2, giving them real value to the average viewer. \n\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/MgG6sMz.gif)\n\n\n  ### The Event\n\n\nThe Nounsvitational will be a world class five-day Dota 2 Tournament featuring ten of the top teams worldwide with the best broadcast talent in the Dota scene held from February 14th to February 18th. This will be a Tier 1 Dota 2 event, and the first LAN in DotA since the International World Championships in October. This will be the long-awaited return of Weplay to the Dota 2 scene (voted best Tournament Organizer in the scene, even surpassing Valve, the game's creator itself), and the first non-traditional Custom Game Mode LAN in several years. Suffice it to say, this event is going to be EXTREMELY hype for the average Dota viewer.\n\nUsing our custom map makers, we will transform the Dota 2 in-game map to be a Nounish playground, full of memes, references, and general Nouns branding so that millions of viewers will see Nouns during the games themselves. Between the games, we will utilize our content creation skills to produce and air custom Nouns video content, which will educate the viewers on Noun's culture, structure, mission, and past projects. \n\nHeld in the Weplay Studio in Los Angeles, we will bring the best teams around the world to play, and invite as many Nouners and Nounsfolk as we can to be part of the audience, for a once in a lifetime exclusive and intimate experience. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/jO0BL0g.jpg)\n\n\n### Integrating the General Public to Web3\n\nThe event itself will get people's attention: they will watch for the unique structure and for the world class competition. But our true goal will be to get the viewers to understand and integrate into the Nouns culture while they watch a fantastic event. \n\nOur plan for this is also 3 fold. \n\n1. Traditional Pre-Event marketing of Giveaways, pushing people to join the Nouns Esports Discord, follow the Nouns Social media, and even give away tickets to attend the event live. Combined with the content we create at the event, we will ensure that people WANT to watch the content we provide, so they can understand the \"scary world of crypto\"\n2. Contacting the best artists and creators in Dota to make custom Dota 2 POAP art, which we will give away to viewers who watch the event. This will not only drive up viewership, but with an integrated system where viewers can trade POAPs for in game cosmetic items, chances to win prizes, and other benefits, we will not only subtly introduce the average viewer to the world of NFTs, we will ensure that they have fun doing it and can trade them for real value. \n3. Creating a \"Mini Dota DAO'' prior to the event, which will not only advertise the event during its duration on Reddit and other platforms, but show the general viewers that not all NFT and Web3 projects are \"bad guys\" and that the Nouns protocol is something that is actually cool, using a real tangible example that makes the Dota 2 community a better place. \n\nWe believe that by letting the viewers not just watch the Event, but actively participate in the event with POAP collecting, exchanging, and voting for how to \"better the world of Dota\" with a Nounish DAO system will achieve the greater purpose of the event. Come for the Dota, Stay for the Nouns.\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/DigBHGf.gif)\n\n### How does this Proposal Benefit Nouns? \n\n* All video content created for the event (the explanatory videos, documentary-like series, etc.) and the content from The Nounsvitational itself will be usable by the Nouns community as both \"proof of concepts\" and general media Nouns will be able to use forever. This media, especially explainer videos on what are Nouns, Web3, and DAOs, have great value for future proposal endeavors.  \n* Fantastic way to showcase current and past Nouns projects to first-time viewers in a captive audience. Can use already created media from other successful Proposals and expand on them with interviews from the people that made them happen\n* HUGE viewership and outreach to a variety of new, interested viewers in the world of Esports (a community that has a lot of crossover with Web3 already) in a positive, productive way in a scene that views other projects very negatively \n* Cements the Nouns brand in a very valuable space with tangible, easy to gather data showcasing sign ups, viewers, and active participants for future project proposals\n* Active (and trackable) onboarding of the general public to Web3 ideas and systems in a fun and dynamic way where they feel rewarded and positive about their experience, which is one of Noun's core goals   \n* Growing Nouns communities by incentivizing viewers to join for access to prizes, events, and other incentives along with getting them onboard with the general Nouns ecosystem\n* Come to LA! Nouns holders as well as Nouns community members can come and be part of the audience for the event, meet the players and the Talent, and have the experience of a lifetime! A great reward for your already amazing community members! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/RNEH3Tt.png) ![](https://i.imgur.com/WmBYAjm.png)\n\n### Ask and Budget Breakdown\n\nTotal Budget: 799 ETH (at $1200) $958,800\n\nCategorized Breakdown:\n- Prizepool - 166 ETH / ~$200,000\n- Flights, Accommodation, Food for Teams: 171 ETH / $205,200\n- Mini Dota DAO Seeding - 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Customization of Dota 2 Map, In-Game integrations - 40 ETH / $48,000\n- Talent Fees - 55 ETH / $66,000\n- POAP Integrations - 7 ETH / $8400\n- VIP Experience for winning Nouners 10 ETH / $12,000\n- Complete Event Fulfillment (Production, Graphics Design, Stage, Venue, Content, Staffing, Security) - 340 ETH / $408000\n\nFunds would be received by a multi-sig (3/4) and then delivered to Weplay.\n- Brennen (Nouner)\n- Sasquatch (Nounsfolk)\n- Maty (Nounsfolk)\n- Kyle (Weplay Operator)\n\n### Event Timeline\n\nMedia Day: Feb 13\nGroup Stage: Feb 14-Feb 15\nPlayoffs: Feb 16-Feb 18\n\n### About Us\n\nWe are Kyle and Slacks, two prominent Dota 2 talent who also work at Weplay.

We hope you will consider our proposal and would love to have any comments, feedback, and suggestions. We want to build this event for you, but also build it WITH you, to make sure we make it as NOUNISH AS POSSIBLE! \n\nThank you\n\nSlacks and Kyle\nWeplay Esports\n\n---\n\n## ADDITIONAL INFO\nStill looking for some more, condensed information? Then please continue reading!\n\n\n### On Dota 2 \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is the 2nd most played game on Steam, the biggest gaming platform in the world. It reaches a global audience with millions of active players each day, and even more viewers on it's Esports events. \n\nCurrently, Dota 2 is experiencing a resurgence of the most viewers and players since 2013! \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ayuGSsx.png)\n\nWhile most Triple A games and Esports require multi-million dollar fee to enter into the sphere with licensing fees and IP protection, Valve allows anyone to do anything with their games, giving full mod tools to players. This allows us to create a very Nounish event for a game with one of the highest viewership numbers in all of Esports. This event would only be possible in Dota, and Dota is our specialty here at Weplay. \n\nIn terms of reach and scale of viewers, the numbers are hard to come by as China and Russia have viewership data that is not easily accessible, but viewership of top events (such as The International and the Weplay Animajor) can reach into the millions from the English audience alone. \n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/NI7SdaC.png)\n\n![](https://i.imgur.com/ViAaXH3.png)\n\nFor a full breakdown of the Viewership of Weplay's last event, please [check out this link](https://escharts.com/news/weplay-animajor-stats) \n\n### On the \"Mini Dota DAO\"\n\nWe know the mission of Nouns is to gather together and pool resources to make the world a better place. But, the concept of a DAO and the betterment of society that can be caused their-in is something completely foreign to most people. To help the viewers understand (and subtly advertise the event) we propose creating a \"Mini DAO,\" a system that is modeled after Nouns itself! \n\nThe process is simple. At the start of the event, we announce that we will take a percentage of the prize pool and allocate that money to \"make Dota 2 better.\" Then, we will start a Reddit thread (Dota 2's primary community hub) where people are able to offer suggested Proposals for how to spend that money to make Dota better. During the duration of the tourney we will actively check in on this thread, promote it, and encourage people to add to the charitable donation if they wish for some in-game perks like having messages appear during the game on the in-game map. At the end of the event, we will have a vote and choose which idea the community suggested to allocate funds to and announce the winner. \n\nThe point of this is for the community to be HEAVILY INVESTED in the tournament and the suggestions in the Mini DAO, but more importantly by the end of this promotion they will VERY CLEARLY understand the Nouns structure and mission, without being simply told how it works.
